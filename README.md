Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This project serves as a personal and shareable configuration setup for various development tools and environments. It aims to help developers quickly set up a consistent and efficient development environment.

## üöÄ Project Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- Manage and version control configurations for development environments and tools, including Z shell, Neovim, and more.
- Provide structured and maintainable configuration for Neovim using Lua, offering an extensible and well-organized setup for code editing, linting, formatting, debugging, and language server support.

## üõ†Ô∏è Neovim Configuration

- **Modular Configuration**: Organized Lua modules for better maintainability.
- **Plugin Management**: Optimized setup using Lazy.nvim for efficient plugin handling.
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Lazy-loading plugins to reduce startup time.
  - Refactoring older Vimscript configurations with Lua-based alternatives.
  - Asynchronous plugin loading for heavy plugins like Treesitter to improve responsiveness.
- **Custom Key Bindings**
- **UI Enhancements**

### Key Features

- **AI-Assisted Development**: Integration with GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat.
- **Auto-Completion & Snippets**: Seamless coding experience with nvim-cmp and snippet support.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced syntax support using Treesitter.
- **Code Formatting & Linting**: Pre-configured tools to maintain code quality.
- **Debugger Integration**: Debugging setup with nvim-dap.
- **LSP Support**: Language server configurations for multiple languages using mason.
- **Git Diff View**: Enhanced Git operations with diffview.nvim.
- **File Browsing**: Efficient file navigation using telescope.nvim.
- **UI Enhancements**: Custom dashboard, status line, onedark color scheme, and indent guides.
